    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.
      </li>

      const article = `when i was little i memorised all the creaks in the floor into mum and dad’s bedroom, so that i wouldn’t wake them if i snuck in.
when he died the house was remodelled and now a new bed sits against a different wall, covering the creaks.
but now i jump up and down. i stomp hard. i bash and kick and thud and stumble, but no one ever hears me.
ever since my dad died, i’ve been alone.
the silence in their bedroom sticks to me like the night on skin.
itching, and irreversible.
i worry about not being found.
